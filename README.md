## License

Since this is quite obviously and directly a derivative work of the [Architeuthis dux](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda) keyboard from tapioki, and they have licensed it under the GPL, I think I have to as well? Not entirely certain. I'm not super concerned about downstream iterations from me, so if you have license questions, talk to tapi ;-)
